###Image re-sizer which aware of output quality.

Work in progress. Currently it aimed to handle image resizing for Android. Interface implemented as a web app (Flask).

For example,

input:
Folder with images, XXHDPI.

output:
Folder with folders drawable-ldpi, ..., drawable-xxhdpi with shrinked images.
